# Face Detection App

## Overview
Welcome to the Face Detection App, a simple yet powerful tool for detecting faces in images. This app utilizes pre-trained face detection models, specifically Haar cascades, to accurately identify and highlight faces within an image.

## Features
- Multiple face detection: The app is capable of detecting multiple faces within a single image.
- Haar cascades: Uses pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers for accurate and efficient face detection.
- User-friendly interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.
- Image upload: Allows users to upload images for face detection.

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.10: Core programming language.
- OpenCV: Library for computer vision, used for Haar cascade-based face detection.
- streamlit: Web framework for building the app.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend development for the user interface.

## Installation

To set up the Face Detection App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-app.git
   cd face-detection-app
